Start off with $5,000 in betting money and place your bets. The player is dealt two cards, and the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Use the "Hit me!" button to add more cards to your hand and "Stand" to keep your current hand. Be careful though, if the total value of your hand exceeds 21, the game will end and you'll have to try again. Test your luck!
